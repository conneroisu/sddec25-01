Successfully implemented hybrid Waterfall + Agile methodology, established effective team collaboration workflows, achieved key milestones per timeline, and identified and mitigated significant project risks.

\section{Impact and Significance}\label{sec:impact-significance}

\subsection{Technical Impact}\label{subsec:technical-impact}

This project demonstrates that software-level optimization (sequential DPU scheduling and pipelined processing) achieves significant performance improvements without hardware upgrades, with implications for resource-constrained AI, real-time medical processing, sequential resource scheduling, and edge computing.

\subsection{Social Impact}\label{subsec:social-impact}

Enhanced assistive technology improves independence~\cite{beauchamp2007ethics}, medical safety through proactive detection, quality of life via responsive control, and reduces caregiver burden.

\section{Final Reflections}\label{sec:final-reflections}

This project demonstrates that thoughtful algorithm design and resource management can overcome hardware limitations in AI-powered assistive technology. The technical innovations, combined with understanding user needs and constraints, have the potential to significantly improve lives by enabling more responsive and reliable assistive technologies for individuals with mobility impairments.
