\section{Project Management and Tracking Procedures}\label{sec:management-procedures}

Our team adopted a hybrid Waterfall + Agile project management approach for this project. This methodology provided us with both the structured framework of Waterfall for critical path activities and the flexibility of Agile for iterative development and testing. This hybrid approach was particularly well-suited for this project because:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The semantic segmentation optimization had clearly defined phases (pipeline architecture design, implementation, testing) that benefited from Waterfall planning
\item The technical nature of implementing pipelined processing, DPU scheduling, and optimizing algorithms required adaptive iterations that benefited from Agile sprints
\item Working with specialized hardware (Kria Board KV260) required careful planning of resource allocation and sequential DPU access scheduling
\end{enumerate}

For project tracking, the team utilized the following tools:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{GitHub}: Primary code repository for version control, documentation, and collaboration. Our client also had access to this repository to track progress in real-time.
\item \textbf{Telegram}: Main communication channel with our client and previous years' team members for quick updates and questions.
\end{itemize}

Weekly team meetings were held to review sprint progress, address blockers, and plan upcoming work. Monthly meetings with the client ensured alignment with project goals and requirements.
