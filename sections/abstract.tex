\begin{abstract}
This research optimizes semantic segmentation algorithms for real-time eye tracking in medical assistive technology~\cite{garcia2017review,ronneberger2015}. We implement efficient sequential DPU scheduling on the AMD Kria KV260 platform, addressing the constraint that the Deep Processing Unit (DPU) can only execute one inference at a time. The proposed pipelined architecture combines multi-threaded CPU processing with sequential DPU execution, reducing latency from 160ms to approximately 8.3ms per frame while maintaining 99.8\% Intersection over Union (IoU) accuracy at 60 frames per second.

The implementation includes deadline-aware DPU scheduling, memory optimization for pipelined data flow, and CPU multi-threading strategies that prevent resource starvation. Current metrics demonstrate 98.8\% IoU accuracy, confirming feasibility of target specifications. This optimization is critical for medical assistance devices serving individuals with mobility impairments, enabling faster detection and response to medical emergencies while preserving user safety and autonomy.
