   \item The interface shall clearly demonstrate the pipelined architecture operation, showing synchronized processing of multiple frames through the CPU preprocessing, DPU inference, and CPU postprocessing stages.
   \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{User Interaction:}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Basic user controls shall be accessible through the XFCE environment, allowing demonstration operators to start, stop, and configure the eye tracking application.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Memory Limitations:}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item The Xilinx Kria K26 board has 4GB of DDR memory~\cite{xilinx2022kv260}, which must be shared among the pipeline stages.
   \item Optimize memory usage to avoid contention between stages and ensure smooth data flow~\cite{chen2022memory}.
   \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{FPGA Resource Allocation:}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item The available FPGA resources are limited and must be efficiently allocated to accommodate the additional logic required for pipelining.
   \item Ensure that the Deep Learning Processing Unit (DPU) is shared effectively between blink detection and eye-tracking submodules.
   \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{DPU Utilization:}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Develop a sequential scheduling strategy for DPU access that efficiently coordinates between blink detection and eye-tracking submodules without causing bottlenecks.
