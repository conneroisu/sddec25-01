\textbf{The Challenge:}

Individuals with mobility impairments using powered wheelchairs face critical medical safety challenges. Medical episodes such as seizures and cardiovascular events can occur suddenly, with limited ability to reposition safely during distress. Current healthcare solutions are reactive, requiring human intervention after an episode occurs, which leads to delayed response times and loss of autonomy.

\textbf{Our Solution:}

VisionAssist leverages AI-powered eye tracking to provide proactive medical monitoring for wheelchair users with conditions like cerebral palsy and epilepsy. The system detects early warning signs of medical episodes through real-time eye movement and posture analysis, enabling autonomous safety response without compromising user independence.

\textbf{Why It Matters:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Enhanced Safety:} Proactive detection prevents critical incidents before they escalate
	\item \textbf{User Independence:} Automated monitoring reduces caregiver burden while maintaining autonomy
	\item \textbf{Privacy-Preserving:} All processing occurs on-device with no cloud dependency
	\item \textbf{Real-Time Response:} Sub-100ms latency enables immediate safety interventions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Clinical Foundation:}

Our approach is grounded in neurological research demonstrating that eye movement patterns contain seizure-specific anomalies that distinguish ictal events from normal behavior. Eyelid dynamics and blink reflex patterns are physiologically linked to neurological state through well-characterized motor control pathways, providing clinically meaningful indicators of medical distress.
