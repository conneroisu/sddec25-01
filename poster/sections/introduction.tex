% Problem statement and motivation

\textbf{The Problem:}

Wheelchair users with conditions like cerebral palsy or epilepsy face sudden medical episodes with limited ability to respond. Current solutions are reactive, not proactive.

\textbf{Our Approach:}

VisionAssist is a \textit{prototype system} designed to explore real-time eye tracking on embedded hardware. It \textit{aims to} enable future medical monitoring capabilities through:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Real-time eye tracking:} 60 FPS semantic segmentation on AMD Kria KV260
  \item \textbf{Privacy-first:} All processing on-device, no cloud
  \item \textbf{Embedded AI:} Optimized U-Net model for edge deployment
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Research Scope:}

This senior design project focuses on \textit{engineering challenges} of real-time embedded AI, not clinical validation. Future work requires IRB-approved user studies.
