## Weekly Summary

Met with client and re-aligned on our current progress and steps going forward. Met with Faculty Advisor and with Professor Fila in order to discuss past semesters achievements and future goals.

## Accomplishments

### Joseph Metzen
Started a slide deck about data management and where the data will be at all times.

### Tyler Schaefer
Shared the current version of the split model.

### Conner Ohnesorge
Presented a multitude of issues that we had as a group with project management and how to solve them to improve the overarching project:

**Current Issues:**
- Hard-coded version-specific instructions
- No automated documentation testing
- Mixed documentation locations (root README, docs/, inline)
- No documentation standards
- Hosted Git Organization management/enforcement of NDA and ease-of-access

### Aidan Perry
Refined script in order to evaluate a matrix in the same format as our CVmatt image. Demonstrate how the image is evaluated and broken up. Will be able to present how this process will be pipelined for our needs.

## Pending Issues

- **Conner Ohnesorge:** I need to create an account and signup for gitlab so that I can join the new git host. Also, will need to distribute the converted split onnx model segments into

- **Aidan Perry:** Techniques used in evaluating the matrix that was developed within the function that the team created, may need to be altered to actually fit the purposes in how we will evaluate the image.

- **Tyler Schaefer:** The split model requires further numerical testing to ensure that it retains accuracy.
