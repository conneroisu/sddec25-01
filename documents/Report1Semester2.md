- **Conner Ohnesorge** – ML Integration HWE
- **Aidan Perry** – Multithreaded Program Developer

## Weekly Summary

Review the goals and requirements of the overall project with the team's client as well as revisit roles and duties of each team member. Plan out tasks into smaller bits, rework the Gantt chart to correspond to new deadlines.

---

## Summer Accomplishments

- **Joseph Metzen:** Looked over Git Repo files. Uploaded images successfully on the Kria Board. Tried to optimize performance with the Kria board.

- **Tyler Schaefer:** Refamiliarized with ML repo and current standing of division of the algorithm.

- **Conner Ohnesorge:** Cleaned up the git repository documentation files.

- **Aidan Perry:** Reviewed most recent task/goal from when we left off last semester, with making revisions to make the matrix (image) example more practically sized for our uses.

---

## Pending Issues

- **Conner Ohnesorge:** Ask JR if we can fix git history to exclude the 4.0 GB of Image Data that should be tracked within git.

- **Aidan Perry:** Created an algorithm that may need to also be altered to fit the size of the matrices that we will be using within our actual system as opposed to our proof of concept example.

- **Joseph Metzen:** Refamiliarize myself with Vitis AI and Docker.

- **Tyler Schaefer:** Get back into a working routine and setup testing for the divided algorithm.

- **Conner Ohnesorge:** Include pictures from this [site/resource](https://real.psych.ubc.ca/images/9/9b/SW_Dikablis_Handbuch_V2.0_ENG.pdf) and cite them as a source in our final report.

- **Aidan Perry:** Refine my proof of concept as well as the algorithm to present to the client for further instruction.
